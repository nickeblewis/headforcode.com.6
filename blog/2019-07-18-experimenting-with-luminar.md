  I have recently started looking at alternatives to Lightroom because sometimes
  it is worth having a look at such things and being open to new ideas,
  especially when they employ modern AI technology, now that had me very
  interested indeed

I have been a Lightroom user for many years and can remember the days when I was using it's predecessor but cannot remember the name of the product other than that Adobe acquired the software house that produced it. Anyway what I haven't been so sure about is the fact that I have to pay a monthly subscription. Yes, I know that it gives me cloud backup and synchronisation across devices. I do miss the days of simply buying a software product and the ability to upgrade for a smaller fee every now and again. So when I heard of Luminar I had to take a look.

The above picture has had some AI enhnacements applied to it which does a great job and staurating and boosting the drama of the clouds, nice job on the contrasts yet it maintains the relative normality and balance of the other elements of the photograph. So aan enhanced, nicely saturated image looks natural and avoids the cliched garish nature of such images when you mention the term HDR for example!
