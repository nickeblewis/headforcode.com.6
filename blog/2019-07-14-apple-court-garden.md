In today's post I want to share a great place we discovered this weekend and at the same time share some photos that I took along the way...

Tina and I have been exploring some more of our great gardens and making some fabulous discoveries. This Saturday we went down towards Lymington armed with a copy of Gardeners World Magazine and a 2-for-1 voucher to visit Apple Court Garden and Nursery, which is stunning as I hope you will agree just by taking a look through some of the photos I took...

As a photographer you discover over time which subjects interest you the most and I have no doubt that nature and gardens are up at the top, expecially when you start to become more adventurous with your approach to photographs. However one thing to keep in mind before going wild with the shutter button is to maintain how recognisable a subject is, which is key for stock photography. Do also take shots of labels for plants, so that later you don't have to recall from the depths of your mind... "What is this plant again? Oh heck, no idea what the latin name is either!"

Apple Court comprises of a number of "Garden Rooms" each connected by corridors that often lead to a feature of some kind. In this case an ornamental seat complete with cushions, which works really well from a photography perspective.
