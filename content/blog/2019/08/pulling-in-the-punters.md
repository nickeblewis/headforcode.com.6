In this post I explore ways of getting your website noticed because it's not easy or at least not like it used to be. The sad truth is just having a website out there, doesn't mean that people will come of their own accord. People need a little bit of a hint, a nudge, which may be based on a number of avenues, such as a keyword based search, responding to an advert or other kind of link that they see. The challenge though is getting that link in front of the right people, your audience, the people you want to speak with and establish long term relationships with. Pull in those punters and keep pulling their pints - I like metaphors!

## Preparing your site to be discovered

Let's consider some prerequisites...

* A good domain name
* Well structured content that aligns with your brand and domain, a good homepage that is kept up-to-date, landing pages for sections of your site
* Quality mark-up
* Google sitemaps
* RSS Feeds
* Accurate metadata
* Relevancy

## Calls to action (CTA)

## SEO

## External linking

You can't beat some external links but be as strategic as you can be in electing your "sponsors". So take for example a local interest group such as [The Bournemouth Jazz Club](https://bournemouthjazzclub.org). Notice my cheeky bit of external linking there, any traffic they receive from _this_ site will be logged with tools such as Google Analytics. So they will know some of their traffic is coming from here but who else could they try? let's have a little think...

* I note that they hold their monthly meetings at the Kinson Community Centre just between Poole and Bournemouth. Ask the venue if they can place a link to their club on their website or if there are posters in the venue, put up some notices there. Links can be non-digital too.
* Once people hit your site, what do you want them to do? You want them to chat with you, to get them interested in perhaps becoming a member of the club. So it's helpful to make this, what we call a CTA (Call to action) fairly visible without being annoying or offputting.
* Once people visit the first time you will want them to come back again in the future, so perhaps entice them to join your mailing list, if you have one. That is another call to action.
* How can further people be attracted to the site and to the club? You can't beat local noticeboards, so try running a paper based campaign but we would not recommend leaflet dropping through doors.
* Consider other similar clubs linking to you
* Music shops, record stores
* Social Media
* Local publications
  
## Newsletters

Invest in a newsletter system, some can be run for free up to a certain number of subscribers, we like MailerLite here for example and use that for our own purposes. 

## Social Media

You need not be on Social Media yourselves but companies like ours love to help in any way we can by promoting your site via our own channels. We can create and run the accounts on your behalf and receive enquiries on your behalf from interested parties. So if you want we could set up @bournemouthjazzclub on Twitter, posting messages there using a tool called CoSchedule to send out messages on certain dates. In the past I've done something similar for Farnborough where we'd promote an event early and again nearer the time. We then start conversations with people who are interested and point them in the direction of the organisers, in this case yourselves.

## Expand the audience beyond the room

What do we mean by this? Well you could record, video some of your meetings or do audio recordings to produce Podcasts. It might be good fun to listen back to some of the presentations later anyway plus that would give newcomers the chance to listen to some of your earlier sessions. You may need to do some clever edits so that the music isn't played in it's entirety.

## More articles

I think the HTML versions of the newsletters I have created for your most recent meetings will help because they refer to quite a lot of Jazz trivia and Google see's all of these things and that can help.
