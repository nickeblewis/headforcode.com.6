[ ] - /screencasts/how i edit this site - write the transcript and record the video :-)
[ ] - check up on my search console, looking like its ramping up and do some test searches on Google, review the clicks and what the keywords were for them

Hmmm - just drilled down to the clicks for this and it may be referring to my old site? However I could translate some of the old content from wordpress to markdown, such as the red kites article? 

[ ] - maybe delete properties in search console for nicklewis.net and start again

[ ] - Disqus would be great too

softwarebyrob.com

[ ] - move my mugshot to the top, should be opener

[ ] - continue content development, find ways of managing it better, though doing it all through VS Code like this seems to be a beautiful way :-)
## Stuff to set up
- [ ] Update Gridsome from 0.6.4 to latest and what changes does that bring update current blog journal
- [ ] I want to make my home apge more of a personal tone, like Kent C dodds and to appeal as a mentor and teacher as much as a faceless business
- [ ] Slack channel headforcode
- [ ] Add something to any of my "incomplete" content pages that are there as placeholders to allow people to make contributions to them or to be updated when they are actually published?
- [x] google sitemap  
- [x] google analytics - isn't this one done?
- [x] content requires it's own template but base it on blog to start with
- [x] change the tags for this article and get content covered by tags in the build
- [x] get the contact form working on Netlify
