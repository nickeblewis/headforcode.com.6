What lives in this folder is a map of my work, my brain (if you like) because as a developer you need to stay on top of so much at once. If you stumble upon this little page whilst surfing the web, please drop a note in the comments below - What interests you right now in technology and/or photography? 

Currently I am reasearching ways of getting more out of Netlify, Headless CMS systems, AI Bots and more! I shall be writing up notes here and transforming them into full articles as they develop into complete enough documents. I could do a write up on this for those interested, to share my writing process which is an ongoing thing.

This area is going to be broken down into the following sections and the reason for this is that I wish to present these sections in different ways. I will elaborate on this in due course.

* blog
* drafts
* explore
* ideas
* learn
* other
* photography
* (photography-old) -> merge this with the above
* services
* solutions
* todo.md

All of the above sections and their pages are wired up to Disqus, so that we encourage engagement with the readers out there.

There is a possibility that if the content grows in certain areas more than expected, that new websites could be formed.
