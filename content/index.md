What lives in this folder is a map of my work, my brain (if you like) because as a developer you need to stay on top of so much at once. If you stumble upon this little page whilst surfing the web, please drop a note in the comments below - What interests you right now in technology and/or photography? 

Currently I am reasearching ways of getting more out of Netlify, Headless CMS systems, AI Bots and more!

This area is going to be broken down into the following sections and the reason for this is that I wish to present these sections in different ways. I will elaborate on this in due course.

* blog
* drafts
* explore
* ideas
* learn
* other
* photography
* (photography-old) -> merge this with the above
* services
* solutions
