## Purpose of this page

As a developer who does a lot of contract and freelance work, I spend a lot of my time training myself, not just in learning new skills but improving my actual approach to learning, which led to the conception of this website. The purpose of this particular page is to maintain a set of notes covering the key areas for that ongoing learning process. I hope that you find it useful too or perhaps it will encourage you to do a similar thing - collate your own list, hone your skills on what matters the most.

- Node's latest developments
- Machine learning and AI - such as website chatbots and so on

## Footnote

This page will be updated again soon no doubt. Please share your lists via the comments below, I am eager to know what other people are learning. Need not be code, it could be a foreign language, sport or other skill? I shall add some non-code topics here soon.
